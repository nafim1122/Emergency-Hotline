## 🎯 **How to Add the Official Bangladesh Government Logo**

If you want to use the official Bangladesh government logo you provided, follow these steps:

### 📋 **Step 1: Save the Logo Image**
1. Save the Bangladesh government logo image as `bangladesh-gov-logo.png`
2. Place it in the `assets/` folder
3. Ensure it's a proper PNG image file (not text)

### 📝 **Step 2: Update HTML Files**
Replace the current logo references in `index.html`:

**Navbar Logo:**
```html
<!-- Change from: -->
<img src="assets/emergency.png" alt="Emergency Hotline Logo" class="logo">

<!-- To: -->
<img src="assets/bangladesh-gov-logo.png" alt="Bangladesh Government Logo" class="logo">
```

**Hero Section Logo:**
```html
<!-- Change from: -->
<img src="assets/emergency.png" alt="Emergency Services Emblem" class="hero-logo">

<!-- To: -->
<img src="assets/bangladesh-gov-logo.png" alt="Bangladesh Government Emblem" class="hero-logo">
```

### 🎨 **Step 3: Optional CSS Adjustments**
The Bangladesh government logo is circular with red and green colors. You might want to enhance the styling:

```css
.logo {
    width: 32px;
    height: 32px;
    object-fit: contain;
    border-radius: 50%; /* Makes it perfectly circular */
    background: white; /* White background for contrast */
    padding: 2px; /* Small padding around logo */
}

.hero-logo {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    object-fit: contain;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 50%;
    padding: 1rem;
    border: 3px solid #e74c3c; /* Red border matching Bangladesh flag */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(231, 76, 60, 0.3); /* Red shadow */
}
```

### ✅ **Current Status**
- ❌ Official Bangladesh government logo: **Not implemented** (image file issue)
- ✅ Working logo: **emergency.png** (currently active)
- ✅ Bengali branding: **জরুরি হটলাইন** (navbar text)
- ✅ Government styling: **Circular design with shadows**

### 🔧 **Why the Logo Wasn't Displayed**
The Bangladesh government logo you provided wasn't displayed because:
1. I created a text placeholder instead of a proper image file
2. Browsers can't display text files as images
3. The `<img>` tag requires actual image files (PNG, JPG, etc.)

### 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. **Save the actual image**: Convert your Bangladesh government logo to a PNG file
2. **Replace the file**: Put it in the `assets/` folder as `bangladesh-gov-logo.png`
3. **Update references**: Change the HTML to point to the new logo
4. **Test**: Refresh the website to see the official government logo

**📱 Once properly implemented, your Emergency Hotline will feature the official Bangladesh Government logo with full authority and recognition!**
